# Overview

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Fluent is a general-purpose, **zkWASM execution layer** for Ethereum. It's an **L2 rollup** that lets developers build high-throughput applications in their favorite programming languages, including Rust, Solidity, TypeScript, and more.

***

The fusion of three key components forms the bedrock of Fluent's architecture:

**1. Rollup Technology**

Fluent leverages rollup technology to remove throughput and cost constraints, enabling developers to build high-performance applications without worrying about scalability issues.

**2. WASM Execution**

By adopting WebAssembly (WASM) execution, Fluent significantly lowers the learning curve for developers. This allows them to utilize their existing knowledge and skills to build dApps, opening doors for a broader developer community to participate in Web3.

**3. EVM Compatibility**

Fluent ensures seamless end-user adoption by maintaining compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standards to capitalize on its network effects. This way, existing Ethereum developers can leverage their expertise while exploring new possibilities through Fluent's advanced features.

### The Fluent Advantage: Experience, Flexibility, and Performance

#### **1. Developer Experience**:

Fluent prioritizes user experience, streamlining the development process, and eliminating unnecessary complexities. By supporting multiple programming languages, developers can work with their preferred tools, making the transition to blockchain development smooth and seamless.

#### **2. Flexibility**:

The platform offers unparalleled flexibility, empowering developers to explore non-EVM and other esoteric programming languages. Fluent understands that diversity in programming languages leads to greater creativity and innovation within the blockchain ecosystem.

#### **3. Performance**:

Fluent sets a new standard for high performance and low-cost execution on the Ethereum network. By leveraging zkWASM rollup technology, developers can build applications that achieve impressive throughput and responsiveness, making it ideal for resource-intensive social and gaming applications.
