# Overview

Fluent brings [WebAssembly (Wasm)](https://webassembly.org/) to Ethereum.

## What is Wasm?

Wasm is a low-level, portable binary format and compilation target for high-level programming languages.

The above sentence probably doesn't mean much to you, so to better illustrate what Wasm is, its impact on web2 and web3, and to further explore its future potential, we recommend reading more [here](https://mirror.xyz/fluentlabs.eth/7I4djVRnKFPkxlr2TYkCiMjmPQuE4vyyWIPK5V9l2h0)


### TLDR

Wasm enables developers to program for Ethereum similarly to how they program for the contemporary web today.&#x20;

It enables the use of nearly any general-purpose programming language, such as Rust, TypeScript and more, along with preferred web2 libraries and frameworks.

## How does Fluent use Wasm?

Fluent uses Wasm as the foundation for its L2, zkVM and the framework.&#x20;

Letâ€™s walk through each of these components.
