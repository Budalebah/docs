# Overview

## What is Wasm(0)?

Wasm(0) is a blockchain platform that functions as a Layer 2 solution and replicates the [WebAssembly](zkwasm-dictionary/wasm-0-wikipedia.md#webassembly) environment. By utilizing the properties of [ZK-based](zkwasm-dictionary/wasm-0-wikipedia.md#zero-knowledge) roll-up mechanisms, such as zkEVM, Wasm(0) can aggregate multiple transactions into a single proof without compromising the security of the blockchain. This approach improves the blockchain's throughput, allowing for greater scalability.&#x20;

The main goal of Wasm(0) is to enable the seamless integration of libraries and applications that utilize WASM technology into the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging the advantages of Layer 2, Wasm(0) can connect traditional WASM-based communities such as web, gaming, socials,  and more, with dApps running on the blockchain. This integration opens up new possibilities for developers and users in the Web3 world.

## Benefits of ZKWasm

<details>

<summary>High-Performance Applications</summary>

Wasm(0) enables high-performance applications to be developed on the blockchain. By leveraging Layer 2 solutions and the properties of ZK-based roll-up mechanisms, multiple transactions can be aggregated into a single proof. This approach increases the blockchain's throughput without sacrificing security.

<details>

<summary>Interoperability</summary>

Interoperability is a significant benefit of Wasm(0). By seamlessly integrating WASM-based applications into the blockchain ecosystem, developers can create applications that can work across multiple blockchains. This allows for greater flexibility and choice for developers and users alike.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Compatibility with Existing Ethereum Ecosystem</summary>

Wasm(0) is specifically tailored to be compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem. As a result, developers can easily integrate their existing applications and libraries with the blockchain. This reduces the learning curve for developers and provides a smooth transition to blockchain development.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Potential for SNARK Integration</summary>

Wasm(0) also explores the potential benefits of integrating SNARK into WASM-based decentralized applications. SNARKs (Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) are zero-knowledge proofs that allow for the validation of computations without revealing the inputs or outputs.&#x20;

This can significantly improve privacy and scalability in decentralized applications. By exploring the potential benefits of integrating SNARK, Wasm(0) is paving the way for greater privacy and scalability in blockchain applications.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Broader Adoption of Blockchain Technology</summary>

Overall, the benefits of Wasm(0) are significant. By enabling high-performance, interoperable applications that are compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem and exploring the potential benefits of integrating SNARK, Wasm(0) is making blockchain technology more accessible to developers and users alike.&#x20;

This can lead to greater adoption of blockchain technology and ultimately, a more decentralized and secure future.
