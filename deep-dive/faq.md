<details>

<summary>What is Fluent?</summary>

A [general-purpose (L2)](https://mirror.xyz/fluentlabs.eth/EyB2e-wqezw2uAaFOsgoJvqaADhujof6d2ut62CKP8Q) rollup on Ethereum that combines the capabilities of [Wasm](https://mirror.xyz/fluentlabs.eth/7I4djVRnKFPkxlr2TYkCiMjmPQuE4vyyWIPK5V9l2h0) and ZK that lets developers build scalable applications in their preferred programming languages.

<details>

<summary><strong>Which programming languages will Fluent support for writing smart contracts?</strong></summary>

Fluent will offer support for a wide range of programming languages that can be compiled into WebAssembly (Wasm).\
\
Initially, Fluent will support languages such as Rust, Solidity, and TypeScript, with potential for expansion to other compatible languages in the future.

<details>

<summary>How does Fluent support Ethereum tooling?</summary>

Fluent provides Ethereum-compatible components, including support for Solidity language, EVM opcode naming conventions for applications, and compatibility with Ethereum data structures such as account/storage trie and block/transaction structure.

<details>

<summary>Do contracts written in Solidity and Wasm languages have the capability to make cross-contract calls to one another?</summary>

Yes.\
\
Contracts written in Solidity and Wasm languages can make cross-contract calls to each other because they both run on WebAssembly, allowing onchain interaction between them.

<details>

<summary>Does Fluent utilize the wasm host API, and what function does it serve within Fluent's architecture?</summary>

Fluent has partial support for its own host API, in addition to partial support for WASI and EVM.\
\
We are actively working on expanding support for various host APIs, including SYS (Fluent's native), WASI, EMSCRIPTEN, EVM, and additional APIs for running WebAssembly inside WebAssembly without overhead, similar to virtualization.\
\
These APIs play a crucial role in enabling interoperability and expanding Fluent's capabilities.

<summary>Wen testnet for Fluent?</summary>

We are very close to the launch of Fluent's private beta testnet and will be onboarding the first few teams and projects.\
