# Building with WebAssembly

As the world becomes increasingly reliant on tech, the benefits of Web3 technology cannot be overlooked. Web3 offers the promise of decentralization, security, and autonomy, allowing individuals and businesses to take control of their data, transactions, and digital assets.

But as with any new technology, there are hurdles to overcome before it can be widely adopted.

## Obstacles to Web3 Mass Adoption

### High Gas Fees and Low Performance

One of the biggest challenges facing Web3 is the issue of high gas fees and low performance. Gas fees are the fees paid by users to execute transactions on a blockchain network. These fees can be high, especially during times of high network activity, which can make it expensive to use dApps built on top of blockchain networks.

In addition, many blockchain networks suffer from slow transaction speeds and low throughput, which can limit the scalability of dApps. This can be a significant obstacle for developers looking to build large-scale applications on blockchain networks.

### Limited Smart Contract Programming Models

Improving smart contract programming models and supporting traditional software languages on the blockchain is another significant challenge in blockchain technology. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into code, and they have become a fundamental component of many blockchain applications.

However, the current smart contract programming models are limited, and their design has been a major barrier to the development of larger applications.

### Lack of Advanced Developer Tooling

Another significant obstacle to the mass adoption of Web3 is the lack of advanced developer tooling. Blockchain development is still in its early stages, and many of the tools and frameworks available to developers are relatively primitive compared to those used in traditional software development.

This can make it challenging for developers to build and deploy dApps on blockchain networks, which can slow down the development process.

### Steep Learning Curve

Finally, the issue of complexity presents a barrier for developers wanting to transition to Web3. Solidity and Vyper, the languages used for building on EVM, are unorthodox and difficult to learn, making it difficult for Web2 developers to contribute to the ecosystem and for the general public to understand and use it. Building with Wasm: A Better Way Forward

## What is Wasm?

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a low-level bytecode format that is designed to run at near-native speed in modern web browsers. It is a new standard that enables developers to write high-performance code that can be compiled into portable binaries that can run on a variety of platforms, including the web.

In the context of Web3, Wasm has emerged as a crucial technology for building decentralized applications (dApps) on blockchains. This is due to its speed, portability and security features.
