# Incrementally Verifiable Computation: NOVA

At Wasm0, we remain vigilant in our efforts to stay abreast of emerging technologies that may impact our field. This includes keeping up with advancements in Supernova, Sangria Origami, and Hypernova. Our goal is to not only be aware of these new developments but to conduct thorough research in order to fully understand their potential impact on our work.&#x20;

The following research describes Nova, a proving system that uses a Folding scheme and KZG polynomial commitments to achieve Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC).&#x20;
