# Plonkish Protocols

Plonkish protocols, generally, look like this:

1. The prover sends commitments to some polynomials.
2. The verifier responds with some challenges.
3. The prover and the verifier repeat this for a number of rounds.
4. The prover opens these polynomials in some points, and the verifier checks some
equations on these openings.
